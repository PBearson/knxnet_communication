Host Protocol Address Information (HPAI): 
- Uniquely identifies the communication channel on the host protocol
- Structure:
    - Structure length
    - Host protocol (e.g., UDP)
    - IP address
    - port

Connection Request Information (CRI):
- Additional information needed to fulfill a connection request

Connection Response Data Block (CRD):
- Data block returned with CONNECT_RESPONSE

Description Information Block (DIB):
- Returns a specific block of device information when responding to DESCRIPTION_REQUEST
- Returns at least 2 DIB structures: 1) device hardware; 2) support service families.
- Device information types:
    - Device information (1)
    - Service families (2)
    - IP configuration (3)
    - Current IP configuration (4)
    - KNX addresses (5)
    - Reserved (6 - 0xfd)
    - Manufacturer-defined data (0xfe)
    - Not used (0xff)

Discovery - SEARCH_REQUEST:
- Send a frame via multicast to the listening endpoints of any listening KNXnet/IP server.
- Connectionless and stateless. The client's discovery endpoint address information is included in the frame body.
- Structure:
    - KNXnet/IP header with service ID 0x0201 (SEARCH_REQUEST)
    - HPAI discovery endpoint

Discovery - SEARCH_RESPONSE:
- Sent by the server as an answer to SEARCH_REQUEST.
- Addressed to the client's discovery endpoint (in the HPAI).
- Returns its HPAI control endpoint, and 2 DIB blocks (device information and supported service families)
- Structure:
    - KNXnet/IP header with service ID 0x0202 (SEARCH_RESPONSE)
    - HPAI control endpoint
    - DIB device hardware
    - DIB supported service families

Description - DESCRIPTION_REQUEST:
- Sent by a client to a server's control endpoint to get a description of the server device.
- Contains the return address of the client's control endpoint.
- Structure:
    - KNXnet/IP header with service ID 0x0203 (DESCRIPTION_REQUEST)
    - HPAI control endpoint

Description - DESCRIPTION_RESPONSE:
- Sent by the server as an answer to DESCRIPTION_REQUEST.
- Addressed to the client's control endpoint (in the HPAI).
- Structure (might include more than 2 DIB structures):
    - KNXnet/IP header with service ID 0x0204 (DESCRIPTION_RESPONSE)
    - DIB device hardware
    - DIB supported service families
